Question:

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. 
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.


Solution:

with pivot_source_01 as (
    select ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) row_number,
    name, 
    occupation
        from OCCUPATIONS

)
select [Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor]  
    from pivot_source_01 
    pivot (
    min(name) for occupation in ([Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor])
) as pivot_table_02
